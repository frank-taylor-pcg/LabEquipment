# LabEquipment
A Unity simulation for various lab equipment

# Current structure
Anything I don't mention was pulled in automatically during setup of one thing or another

### Materials
Collection of materials I created to texture things

### Prefabs
Collection of reusable components
  
### Scenes
Collection of scenes

SampleScene
- Contains results of my boredom during a day of nothing but meetings. I mocked out a cart, complete with trays and 'barcodes' and I was starting to greybox out the frame.  Also, I have a non-functioning 3rd person controller I started, but got distracted and haven't yet finished.

Scenes/ScannerTest
- The beginnings of a tray elevator, complete with a stack of 25 barcodes to scan.  Not currently functional as I was just moving it up but wanted to flesh out the actual 'stage' or 'axis' component to use here.  Also contains prefabs for the tower safety light and the door request and system reset buttons.

Scenes/AxisTesting
- Tests for linear stages

### Shaders
A place for shaders that will be used to render special effects. The current shader I'm working on is a text rendering shader to show the text value of the barcodes

### Textures
Currently only contains a bitmap font I plan to use with the text shader
